// Like Java, abstract keyword is used to declare abstract classes in Kotlin. 
// An abstract class cannot be instantiated (you cannot create objects of an abstract class).
//  However, you can inherit subclasses from can them.

// Note: Abstract classes are always open. 
// You do not need to explicitly use open keyword to inherit subclasses from them.

    Multiple initializer blocks can be written in a class. Theyâ€™ll be executed sequentially
